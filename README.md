# Mobile Flashcards App

This app was built as the final project submission for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.
It is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards/questions to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

It was designed for Android and tested on Pixel (emulator) and Samsung Galaxy (physical device). Most components will also work on IOS.
